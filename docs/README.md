# Documentation Index

The utility repository hosts shared Python modules, deployment tooling, and assets used by both the controller and the robot runtime.

- [`modules.md`](modules.md): Functional overview of the Python packages (`logging_conf`, `utils_static`, communication helpers, etc.).
- [`deployment.md`](deployment.md): Guidance for using the Ansible playbooks and Makefile stubs shipped with the utilities.
- [`logging.md`](logging.md): Details about the shared logging configuration, including the dynamic class-name formatter.
- [`../README.md`](../README.md): Quickstart section (to be expanded).

Cross-repository documentation:
- Controller stack: `../dadou_control_ros/docs/README.md`
- Robot runtime: `../dadou_robot_ros/docs/README.md`
